An independent press is critical to the health of a democracy. As the Indian govt continues to erode the freedoms of speech and press around the #FarmersProtest, we look to @POTUS to follow in the footsteps of multiple elected officials and strongly condemn this behavior.
As a result, news coverage by journalists and activists on social media platforms like @Twitter and online news outlets @thewire_in and @newslaundry have played a critical role in providing real-time reporting from the ground at the #FarmersProtest.
Since Nov, the #FarmersProtest has united farmers across the country to take a stand for their livelihoods against farming bills the Indian govt rushed to pass. In its anti-democratic response, the govt has tried to paint protestors as ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù through media narratives.
If you ate today, Thank A Farmer.  #FarmersProtest

Rahul Gandhi is not going to play ball with Pawar's tantrums. If Pawar thinks that Supriya's career is safe with BJP,  He should go ahead with the NDA.  As for Modi, former AgriMinister from farmlands will not be able to pacify #FarmersProtest of Punjab &amp; Haryana try all he want.
@ndtv Farm laws are not new. They were introduced earlier also. After a year of success, farmers paid heavy price. Late George Fernandis was instrumental in pushing the Cong govt to withdraw. They did. Modi laws are much more worse. Wakeup India. #FarmersProtest

@ndtv If  GDP was at +10perc, one may not have felt the pinch of black 3Agri laws. That perc would have pushed MSP for farmers irrespective of Govt gurantees. 2day  -ve GDP, high jobloss rates, liw buying power, farmers are bound to bleed to death. #FarmersProtest #NoVoteToBJP
